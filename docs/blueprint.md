## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Very light blue (#E8EAF6), which will give a light mode vibe but isn't stark white.
- Accent color: A vibrant violet color (#7E57C2), will create contrast while staying within an analogous palette.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, which is highly readable in a UI setting.
- Use clean and simple vector icons to represent transaction categories and other actions.
- Design a clean, intuitive, mobile-first responsive layout.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions for a smooth user experience.
